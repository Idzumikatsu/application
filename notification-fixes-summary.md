# Notification System Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified
1. The NotificationController.java file contained the NotificationBroadcastService class instead of being a proper controller
2. The NotificationBroadcastService class was in the controller package instead of the service package
3. The NotificationController was missing proper REST endpoints for notification management

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Created Proper NotificationController
- Created a new NotificationController in the correct package (com.crm.system.controller)
- Implemented REST endpoints for:
  - Retrieving notifications by recipient
  - Getting notification by ID
  - Marking notifications as read
  - Getting unread notification count
  - Retrieving pending notifications
  - Retrieving unread notifications with pagination
  - Marking all notifications as read

### 2. Moved NotificationBroadcastService to Correct Location
- Moved the NotificationBroadcastService class from the controller package to the service package
- Fixed the package declaration from `com.crm.system.controller` to `com.crm.system.service`
- Removed controller-specific annotations and methods from the service class
- Ensured the service class only contains business logic and scheduled tasks

### 3. Verified API Endpoints
- Confirmed all required methods exist in the NotificationService
- Verified the NotificationDto class exists for data transfer
- Ensured proper security annotations are in place

## Files Modified
1. `/opt/application/crm-system/src/main/java/com/crm/system/controller/NotificationController.java` - New proper controller
2. `/opt/application/crm-system/src/main/java/com/crm/system/service/NotificationBroadcastService.java` - Fixed package declaration and removed controller methods

## Benefits
- Clean separation of concerns between controller and service layers
- Proper REST API endpoints for notification management
- Consistent with the rest of the application architecture
- Improved maintainability and code organization
